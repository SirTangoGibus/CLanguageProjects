# Recursivity
Contains the following:

My_compute_factorial_it: An iterative function that returns the factorial of the number given as a parameter. In case of an error, it returns 0.

My_compute_factorial_rec:  A recursive function that returns the factorial of the number given as a parameter. In case of an error, it returns 0.

My_compute_power_it: An iterative function that returns the first argument raised to the power p, where p is the second
argument.

My_compute_power_rec: A recursive function that returns the first argument raised to the power p, where p is the second
argument.
